## 1 - K-Means Clustering algorithm
Tags: Machine Learning
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique. This can be used when unlabeled data is available.

Steps:
1. Pick K random points from the dataset as initial cluster centroids
2. Find distance of each point in the dataset to each of the K centroids and assign the point to the cluster of the nearest centroid
3. Compute new centroid for each cluster
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until none of the centroids change
